While building an Expo project, I encountered a rather unusual error. The error message itself wasn't very descriptive, merely stating 'Unexpected token' or a similar generic message, and pointed towards a seemingly innocuous line in my code. The error was intermittent and did not appear consistently, making debugging difficult.  I tried various standard debugging techniques (restarting the server, cleaning the cache, etc.) to no avail. The code snippet that seemingly caused the issue was straightforward â€“ a standard import statement and a component declaration.  What made it particularly strange is that the code worked perfectly on other machines and when the code was moved to a different directory or project. This points towards some unexpected environment issue or configuration mismatch.
