The solution turned out to be related to a corrupted Expo cache or a conflict between different versions of Node.js or npm.  A complete reinstall of the Expo CLI along with clearing the cache resolved the issue.  Additionally, ensuring the correct Node.js and npm versions are installed and consistent (as specified in the Expo documentation) is a good preventative measure. The updated code itself remains the same as it was not the source of the error. However, this issue highlights the importance of verifying dependencies and maintaining a clean and consistent project environment.
